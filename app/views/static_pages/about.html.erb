				<p class = "paragraphLeft bodyFont">I've had the opportunity to learn and test out a lot of things. I studied Economics and Statistics at the University of Missouri, both of which I enjoyed. I travelled for 5 months in Missouri, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Minnesota, and it was cheaper than traveling to Europe for one week. After the trip, I decide to forgo graduate school in Mathematics and learn how to program. I love it. My roommates are guiding me on how to go about learning and I have gotten to work on a few projects. I'm just trying to learn as quickly as I can, and wait for an opportunity to arise.</p>

					<li>I earned my Bachelor of Science degrees in Statistics and Economics</li>
					<li>So it turns out that Statistics counted as my foreign language...</li>
					<li>I was a volunteer firefighter for two years during college</li>
					<li>I had the opportunity to travel the U.S. for 5 months after college</li>
					<li>Outside of work and programming, my main hobby is rock climbing</li>
					<li>Rock climbing in Misouri? Isn't that an oxymoron?</li>
					<li>I am trying to grow out my beard. 6 months and counting!</li>
